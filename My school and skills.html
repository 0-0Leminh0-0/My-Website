        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p> Currently, I'm actively studying at Ho Chi Minh City's Tran Dai Nghia High School for the Gifted. A famous and excellent school in all of the Vietnamese High School across the country. I'm always excited to learn and grow as a web developer, and I'm eager to share my knowledge and skills with others in the same field.</p>
